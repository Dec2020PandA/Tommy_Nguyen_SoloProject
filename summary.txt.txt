Project Travel Dashboard

* Summary of Project *
The goal of the project is to allow users to create personal, easy to read trip plans. 
A typical travel plan would be created in a spreadsheet, and we all know those can sometimes
be painful to look at. Not only that but it isn't as appealing to the eye. I want to create this
project to make trip planning easier and better visually. The goal is to have a user be able to 
create as many trips as they like, and to freely plan their trip, from the budget, to the day to 
day activities.
